HDUP2 - README

   To compile and install hdup2 just do a:
   ./configure && make install

Current Issues
#1
   hdup2 does not include directory information in the backup. Why? Because
   Gnu tar cannot handle that correctly. If hdup2 would include this
   information in the backup list, the backup (ie. the tar file) would
   include everything twice! Yes, this is a bug in Gnu tar and will be
   fixed eventually.
   So hdup2 does not include this information.

   Related to this is that empty directories are not included in the
   archive.

   As soon as Gnu tar can handle this, hdup2 will be able to handle 
   this.

#2
   See http://www.miek.nl/cgi-bin/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=5
   Some Gnu Tar seems to have an issue with files having '\' (backslashes)
   in them. 

#3 
   Older tar's (1.3.25) do not work reliabily with hdup2. If you cannot
   upgrade Gnu tar to a more modern version don't upgrade to hdup2, but 
   stay with hdup1.6. Current Gnu tar releases are for instance 1.15.1.
