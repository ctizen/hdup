10 Dec 2005: 2.0.14 Miek <miek@miek.nl>
  - bugfix release -
  * bug #3: when adding a file to the filelist also use NULL
    as a delimeter, not a newline. (Thanks to Chad Sawatzky
    for reporting)
  * Overhauled the tarball making. It's now distributed as
    hdup2-<version>.tar.bz2 and unpacks in hdup-<version>/
    directory.

25 Nov 2005: 2.0.13 Miek <miek@miek.nl>
  - bugfix release -
  * Don't create a LOCK file when restoring
  * Cosmetic updates to the restore code were made
  [bugs]
  * Fixed a NULL derefence when restoring
  * Make the bytes counter a unsigned long long, to avoid the
    overflow at 4 GB.

02 Oct 2005: 2.0.12 Miek <miek@miek.nl>
  - very minor bug fix release -
  [bugs]
  * Don't display the -P warning when receiving a remote archive - 
    as it is useless then.
  * Don't say a remote archive failed to be written when in fact
    it did succeed.
  [build]
  * cleanup the svn directory
  * re-add the examples/ dir, this was somehow lost during my
    harddisk crash

30 Sept 2005: 2.0.11 Miek <miek@miek.nl>
  - minor bug fix and feature additions release -
  [bugs]
  * Debian bug #322421 fixed. Static is now 'static' and not 'stati'
  * Minor corrections to hdup.conf(5)
  * Skip is now always enabled 
  * Install a script which says to put your monthly dump
    on permanent storage (isn't enabled by default)
  * With -VV -D a list of backed up files it printed
  * Show the amount of bytes written when doing a remote
    backup. The logging and overview message have changed
    slightly for this change, resp:
    o   Bytes written:  46K
    and:
    o   SUCCESS, elektron (monthly): 22K, 0:00:00
  * If hdup is set suid or sgid it refuses to run as hdup
    was never designed to handle that.
  * A double free in the postrun/prerun code was fixed.
  * Add a warning when running without -P (patched tar) - as this 
    might lead to incomplete backups

07 Aug 2005: 2.0.10 Miek <miek@miek.nl>
  - small bug fix release -
  [bugs]
  * Used bfbtester to make hdup more robust
  * Bug #23: -s <file> (specific restore) is working again
  * Set default prefix back to /usr
  * Use \0 as a delimeter when creating the filelist. Tar
    is now called with --null.
  * Correctly display the help when using long options (reformatted
    it too)

04 Jul 2005: 2.0.9 Miek <miek@miek.nl>
  - major bug fixes - 
  [bugs]
  * -P flag was added, which stands for patched-tar, this enables
    --no-recusion for tar and allows directory information to be
    included in the archives. See Debian bug: 302790
    Instruction and the patch to tar are on the hdup project page.
  * Bug #22: don't use isblank() because it's a gnu-ism
  * removed unneeded reference to /home/miekg in contrib/dirinfo.sh (thanks
    to Crispin Boylan for spotting)
  * @sysconfdir@ fixes and tweaks. Patches and ideas from 
    Francesco P. Lovergine and Adam Piatyszek.
  [remarks]
  * There are warnings when compiling on FreeBSD (MIN/MAX redefined). These
    are harmless and besides they are in system libs, so I can not fix
    them...

22 Jun 2005: 2.0.8 Miek <miek@miek.nl>
  - bug fixes -
  [bugs]
  * When restoring the pre-run command was run twice.
    (Found, fix, patch by Arnaud de Grandmaison)
  * When restoring the check to see if an archive exists should
    be done after the pre-run script ran.
    (Found, fix, patch by Arnaud de Grandmaison)
  * $DESTDIR failed to make in the Makefile, so applied patch again
  * Check 'keyword=<empty>' in the config file and emit a warning that
    that prob. won't work. (Thanks to Billy Newsom for reporting)
  * Added contrib/hdup.sh - a small script to help manage your backups
    (From: Juraj.Kubelk)
  * Bug #21: update the link to gnu tar on the website, (thanks to Robert
    Locke). Also update the FAQ.html in the hdup2 tar.
  * Added a rough bash shell script that can add the missing directory
    info to an archive (not impl./not tested). This is a quick hack. In 
    2.0.9 I hope to have a better solution.

18 Mar 2005: 2.0.7 Miek <miek@miek.nl>
  - bug fixes -
  [Bugs]
  * Really allow \, in the config file. This is done with
    an evil hack whereby \, is rewritten as <space>\. It's
    ugly but I'll leave it in (until I rewrite the whole
    parser in yacc/lex someday - if ever).
  * The locking has changed and now uses open(bla, O_EXCL|O_CREAT)
    This closes a race condition - but this fails on older NFS < 3,
    but I don't expect anybody to run that these days.
    (thanks to Hotzi for reporting and testing)
  * When adding a / to a path, be sure there is room, a few people
    were bitten by this. [Bug #19]
  * Applied $DESTDIR patch from Richard Bos, allows mortal users
    to make an RPM, this may impact other package creators.

03 Feb 2005: 2.0.6 Miek <miek@miek.nl>
  - bug fixes -
  [Bugs]
  * Fix a bug whereby the files to be backed up where 
    not counted correctly (patch from:  Peter Baumann)
    This could lead hdup2 into creating an empty archive,
    while it should have backed up something. 
  * Thanks also go to Hotzi for pre-testing this release.
  * Due to some Debian weirdness my bugzilla database
    experienced some weirdness. I've lost some bug reports
    in the process, but the old ones are back again :)
    [I have to look into this in detail]
  * Cleanup LOCK files when compilation in the regexps
    fails.
  * Allow \, in the config file. (This fixes another 
    debian bug)
  * Added -D switch to print debugging information
  * Make one-filesystem working again (Thanks to Peter
    Baumann)
  * When restoring give a warning when an entered date
    is likely not to match the current date format.
  * Some changes in the remote restore code to make it
    more robust.
  * Updated the online FAQ on miek.nl
  * Disallow -s <file> and remote restore (for now)

  * Small addition to hdup.conf example (290599@bugs.debian.org)
    related to the include/exclude examples in there
